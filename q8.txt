8. Write a python program “8.py” that takes a string “s” and a natural number “n” as command
line argument. “n” should be smaller than or equal to the length of “s”; if not, then ask the
user to enter “n” again (Until “n” < length(s) ). This program should find the number of “n”
letter words that can be formed from the string. (Repetition of characters is not allowed)
Example:
python 8.py Mississippi 4
7920
python 8.py Missi 10
Length of “Missi” is smaller than 10. Enter n again: 6
Length of “Missi” is smaller than 6. Enter n again: 1
5
python 8.py “Miss issi ppi” 4
7920
